### MVP:
1. Create a page that allows users to search for books
1. Page should include the following:
    - Header section introducing the page
    - Form containing a text input and a submit / search button
    - A grid of books
## Instructions:
-   When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the
    Google books API using the input value as your query string
-   The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.
-   Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
-   The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes
-   You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then
## Styling (required):
-   This application should look good, take some time to pick a palette and
    plan out your design. You can use tools like Figma or wireframe pro to
    plan what your application is going to look like.
-   Styling must use BEM, and each block should have its own SCSS file
-   Your palette should use variables
